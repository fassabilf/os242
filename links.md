This Quora discussion answers the question, "Why is the Linux kernel written in C and not C++?" It explains the core reasons why C remains an essential language in operating system development. The discussion provides solid motivation to learn C, especially in the context of system efficiency and its advantages over other languages.

## Week 3: File System & FUSE

### [Introduction to File Systems and FUSE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBkZynNIZWk&ab_channel=M.AnwarMa%27sum)
This video provides an introduction to file systems and the Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE). It discusses the structure of file systems and how FUSE allows for custom file systems to run in user space rather than kernel space.

## Week 4: Addressing, Shared Lib, & Pointer

### [Addressing, Shared Lib, & Pointer](https://youtu.be/uFj7mKNq1t0)
In this video, the concepts of addressing, shared libraries, and pointers are explored in depth. It starts with a detailed explanation of how memory addressing works, including the difference between logical and physical addresses. The lecturer goes on to discuss the importance of pointers in C programming, explaining how they reference memory locations directly. There's also a clear explanation of how shared libraries function, with practical examples of how memory is allocated and accessed during runtime, along with the significance of pointers in managing data efficiently.
